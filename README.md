# Verilog DevContainer Template for Visual Studio Code

![GitHub License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Overview

This project provides a development environment setup using Visual Studio Code and DevContainers for Verilog and Cocotb development. It is designed to simplify the process of setting up a consistent and reusable environment for Verilog development.

## Features

- A pre-configured environment for Verilog and Cocotb development.
- A fully containerized development environment, ensuring consistency across different machines.
- Seamless integration with Visual Studio Code, providing a familiar IDE experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with this template, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/johnnymn/verilog-cocotb-devcontainer.git
   ```

3. Open the cloned repository in Visual Studio Code.

4. Visual Studio Code should automatically detect the DevContainer configuration and prompt you to "Reopen in Container." Click on this prompt to create and open the development environment.

5. You now have a fully configured environment for Verilog and Cocotb development.

## Usage

Inside the DevContainer, you can use this environment just like a regular Verilog development setup. Some of the key features of this template include:

- [Cocotb](https://github.com/cocotb/cocotb) for writing testbenches in Python.
- Common Verilog tools like Verilator, Icarus Verilog, and Verible are pre-configured and ready for use.
- [Visual Studio Code Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace) for Verilog and Python support.

Feel free to customize this template to suit your specific project requirements.
